# Physics Class - Moon Lander
---

## The Project
Moon Lander is the prototype of a game based on the 1979 game: Lunar Lander by Atari

### The Game
Your objective is to safely land your ship, represented by the red rectangle, on one of the green platforms with good speed and with your ship facing straight up.  If you land it too hard or on the ship's side, or even outside the platforms, your ship will blow up. Be careful, but not too careful, your fuel's not limitless and you will lose control if you run out of it.

### How to Launch It
